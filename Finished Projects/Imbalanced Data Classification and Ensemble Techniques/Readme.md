# ðŸŒŸ Imbalanced Data Classification and Ensemble Techniques ðŸŒŸ

## Overview
This project focuses on addressing imbalanced data classification using ensemble techniques such as bagging, boosting, and stacking. It begins with preprocessing steps, including missing value imputation using MICE (Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations) and oversampling techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) and ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling). The main objective is to train and evaluate machine learning models on imputed data to handle class imbalance effectively.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, etc.

## Project Structure
- `Training_Model_on_Imputed_Data.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the main workflow of the project. It covers data preprocessing, oversampling, classification learning using various algorithms, model evaluation, and ensemble techniques implementation.
- `imputed_encoded_data.csv`: CSV file containing the imputed and encoded data after preprocessing.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Instructions
1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Install the necessary libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook `Training_Model_on_Imputed_Data.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Follow the instructions and explanations provided in the notebook to understand each step of the project workflow.
5. Experiment with different parameters, algorithms, and ensemble techniques to optimize model performance.
6. Refer to the documentation for detailed explanations and insights on each stage of the project.
