USA Housing Price Prediction
Overview
This project aims to predict housing prices in the USA using linear regression. The dataset, named "USA_Housing.csv," is sourced from Kaggle and contains relevant features for predicting housing prices.

Project Structure
1. Notebooks
The notebook folder contains Jupyter Notebooks that walk through the various stages of the project, including data exploration, model training, and evaluation.

2. Model
The model folder houses the saved model file in pickle format (model.pkl). This file contains the trained linear regression model, ready to be loaded and used for making predictions.

3. Dataset
The dataset, named "USA_Housing.csv," is stored in the dataset folder. It serves as the foundation for model training and includes features such as house size, number of bedrooms, and location.

Instructions
Explore the Jupyter Notebooks in the notebook folder to understand the data analysis and model training process.

Use the trained linear regression model saved in the model folder (model.pkl) to make predictions based on new input data.

The raw dataset, "USA_Housing.csv," is available in the dataset folder for reference and further analysis.
